== Introduction (Zeke)
Welcome! This document is a user guide written for you and other users of our travel companion, Volant. It will cover
how you can use and navigate through Volant's features so that you can get started with your travel planning.

Volant is a travel companion application for solo travellers for who *prefer to use a desktop app to manage their travels*.

.Home page of Volant
image::Ui.png[align="center"]

Volant is *optimised for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, Volant can get you planning, executing and reflecting on your trip faster than traditional GUI apps. All while enjoying our retro-inspired GUI.

Interested? Wait no further, jump to <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

[[Features]]
== Features (Zeke)
This section describes the various features available in Volant.
These include front-end features that you can interact with, such as the `TRIP` page, as well as back-end features such as the auto-saving of data.

=== Trips
You can create a new `TRIP` you to help you plan for your upcoming overseas trip.

In Volant, a `TRIP` represents a set of travel plans to a certain `LOCATION` within a date range.
You can create and store trips in Volant to keep track of all your travels, plan your future travels and label
each `TRIP` with a specific `TRIP_NAME`.

Each `TRIP` contains trip features such as an `ITINERARY` and `JOURNAL` to help you conveniently keep track of all things
associated with your `TRIP`!

=== Home Page
You can view all your past and upcoming trips at one glance on the `HOME` page.

This `TRIP` list is neatly organised into two sections: your upcoming trips and your past trips.

=== Journal
To record your thoughts and memories during your trip, you can write journal entries in Volant.
Volant has a `JOURNAL` feature that allows you to write and organise journal entries for every `TRIP`.

These entries are limited to 280 characters and allow users to include the `LOCATION` and `WEATHER` at the time of writing.

=== Itinerary
You can plan activities to do on your trip in the `ITINERARY` of your trip.
This itinerary feature enables you to keep track of your daily activities planned for your trip.
All activities are sorted in chronological order by default, with the first activity of the trip on top.

<<<

[[data-storage]]
=== Data Storage and Auto-Saving of Data
In Volant, every `TRIP` you create will generate a folder named after the `TRIP_NAME`.
This folder can be found in the `data` folder, under the directory that you have previously stored the Volant JAR file in.
This folder stores all data associated with your `TRIP` 's `ITINERARY` and `JOURNAL`.

The `data` folder also contains a data file that stores your trip list and their respective details.

.Diagram of data storage in Volant
image::user-guide/data-storage.png[align="center"]

IMPORTANT: Please do not edit the `volant.json` file, or the data of all your trips might be lost!

If you are concerned that you may forget to save your data every now and then, do not fret!
Any changes that you make to your trips, journal or itinerary will automatically be saved upon every command that you give to Volant.

=== Fast In-App Navigation
You can navigate to the different pages of Volant quickly and efficiently, with universal commands like `home` and `back`.
These commands help you to conveniently move through the pages in Volant without even touching your mouse!

In addition, certain commands such as `goto itinerary` can be shortened to `goto i`, so that you save those few precious seconds of your time.

<<<
