== Introduction

Volant is a travel companion application for solo travellers for who *prefer to use a desktop app to manage their travels*. More importantly, Volant is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Volant can get you planning, executing and reflecting on your trip faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!
