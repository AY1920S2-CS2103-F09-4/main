=== Trips
You can create a new `TRIP` you to help you plan for your upcoming trip overseas.

In Volant, a `TRIP` represents a set of travel plans to a certain `LOCATION` within a date range.
You can create and store trips in Volant to keep track of all your travels, plan your future travels and label
each `TRIP` with a specific `TRIP_NAME`.

Each `TRIP` contains trip features such as an `ITINERARY` and `JOURNAL` to help you convenintly keep track of all things
associated with your `TRIP`!

=== Home Page
You can view all your past and upcoming trips at one glance on the `HOME` Page.

Your `TRIP` list is neatly organised into two sections: your upcoming trips and your past trips.

=== Journal
To help you save your thoughts and memories during your trip, you can write and record journal entries in Volant.  Volant has a `JOURNAL` feature that allows you to write and record journal entries for every `TRIP`.

These entries are limited to 280 characters and allow users to include the `LOCATION` and `WEATHER` at the time of writing.

=== Itinerary

All activities are sorted in chronological order by default, with the first activity of the trip on top.

[[data-storage]]
=== Data Storage and Auto-Saving of Data
In Volant, every `TRIP` you create will generate a folder named after the `TRIP` 's `TRIP_NAME` within the *data* folder within
the directory you have stored in Volant JAR file in. This folder will store all data associated with your `TRIP` 's `ITINERARY` and `JOURNAL`.

The data folder also contains a file, `volant.json` that stores your trip list and their details such as the `TRIP_NAME`, `LOCATION` and date range of all your trips
