These include front-end features that users can interact with, such as the Trip Page, as well as back-end features such as the auto-saving of data.

=== Trips
If you would like to plan for an upcoming trip, you can create a new `TRIP`.
In Volant, a trip represents a set of travel plans to a certain location within a date range. You can able to create and store trips in Volant to keep track of all your travels, and plan your future travels.
Each `TRIP` contains trip features such as an `ITINERARY` and `JOURNAL`.

=== Home Page
If you would like to view all your past trips and upcoming trips at one glance, you can view them on the Home Page.
The trip list is neatly organised into two section: upcoming trips and past trips.

=== Journal
If you have some thoughts that you would like to pen down during, before or after your trip, you can write it into a journal entry.
Volant has a journal feature that allows you to write and store journal entries for each trip.
These entries are limited to 280 characters and allow users to include the `LOCATION` and `WEATHER` at the time of writing.

=== Itinerary
If you would like to plan the activities to do on your trip, you can do so in the `ITINERARY` of each trip.
This itinerary feature enables you to keep track of your daily activities planned for your trip.
All activities are sorted in chronological order by default, with newest entries at the top.

=== Auto-Saving of Data
If you are concerned that you may forget to save your data every now and then, do not fret.
All changes in data will automatically be saved upon every command that the user gives to Volant.

=== Fast In-App Navigation
Navigation within the different pages in Volant is simple and fast, with universal commands like `home` and `back`.
In addition, navigating to a specific item in a list can be done with a shortcut. For example, users can input `goto i` instead of `goto itinerary`.

In this application, commands are used to utilise and switch between these features. The upcoming section will cover the
usage of these commands.
