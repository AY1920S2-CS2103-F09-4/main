Hello, my name is Zeke. At the time of this project (AY19/20), I was a Year 2 Computer Science undergraduate.

I am a developer for `PROJECT: Volant`.

== PROJECT: Volant

Volant is a travel assistant desktop application aimed at assisting solo travellers with the logistics of planning
their travels. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java and
it is primarily based off of the Address Book 3 application developed by the CS2103T teaching team.

* *Major Enhancement:* Implemented storage for the entire project.
** What it does: Allowed users to save and load their data when using the project.
** Highlights: The implementation of the storage was a bottleneck for our team project as in order to
implement and test the functionalities of our features, developers had to have data to work with.

* *Major Enhancement:* Implemented Add command for Activity in Itinerary feature of application
** What it does: Allows users to add an activity to their itinerary.

* *Major Enhancement:* Implemented exceptions for catching logic bugs for Trip and Itinerary feature.
** Justification: In placing these exceptions, the functionality of the project is not compromised.
** What it does: Catches logically invalid commands that the user may enter. E.g. The timing for an activity in the itinerary being outside of the date range of the trip.

* *Major Enhancement:* Implemented the GUI for the application.

* *Other Contributions*
** Documentation
*** Wrote the initial draft for UserGuide.
