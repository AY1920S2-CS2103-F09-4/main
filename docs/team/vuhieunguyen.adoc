== Introduction
Hello, my name is Vu Hieu Nguyen, and I am currently a year 2 Computer Science student
at National University of Singapore.

Thank you for choosing to use our travel companion, Volant. I am a member of
Team Volant, which consists of five students developers, who developed Volant
as our CS2103T Software Development module group project.

== PROJECT: Volant

Volant is a travel assistant desktop application aimed at assisting solo travellers with the logistics of planning
their travels. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java and
it is primarily based off of the Address Book 3 application developed by the CS2103T teaching team.

=== Summary of Contributions
I am responsible for `ITINERARY` features with Zeke and am the main tester of Volant. You can view my code contributions to this project
https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/#search=vuhieunguyen&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=false&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false[on RepoSense].

* *Major Enhancement:* Implemented Itinerary Page of application (with Zeke)
** What it does: Allow users to view and manipulate the itinerary with
different activities in the application.

* *Testing:* Refactored the code base for JUnit testing
** Justification: Most of the original test code was for Address Book 3. These codes were
modified and changed to fit our design of Volant.

* *Testing:* Did JUnit testing for `ITINERARY` (with Zeke)
** Highlights: I added JUnit tests for itinerary's commands and parsers, while Zeke
added JUnit tests for itinerary's model and storage.
