== Introduction
Hello, my name is Ranice. At the time of this project (AY19/20 Semester 2) I was a Year 2 Computer Science undergraduate.

I am the team leader of `PROJECT: Volant` (not by choice).

You can find out more about who I am at these links:

== PROJECT: Volant

Volant is a travel assistant desktop application aimed at assisting solo travellers with the logistics of planning
their travels. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java and
it is primarily based off of the Address Book 3 application developed by the CS2103T teaching team.

==== Enhancements Implemented

* *Major Enhancement:* Implemented mechanism for view switching through `MainWindow.java`
** *What it does* +
    Allows users to navigate between different pages in the application and execute commands in different contexts.
More information about this enhancement can be found https://www.ranice.net/main/DeveloperGuide.html#view-switching[here].
** *Justification* +
    Rather than placing all features in one convoluted view, users are able to focus on one single view.
** *Highlights* +
    The implementation of the view switching mechanism was a bottleneck for our team project as in order to
implement and test the other features of the application, developers must be able to switch between views.
+
This was not easy to do, I spent a lot of time trying to figure out the mechanics of how to do it as it involves refactoring
the logic of the program and the `.fxml` files in order to see the results. Because of this mechanism, every page has to
have its own logic and model. This also allows for similar keywords to be used on each page.
For more information on the implementation of this enhancement, please https://ay1920s2-cs2103t-f09-4.github.io/main/DeveloperGuide.html#implementation-view-switching[click here.]
+
Rather than creating custom commands for each page and a single logic component, it is neater to abstract and create a
logic and model component for each page. That way commands with a single keyword e.g. `add`, `delete` can be used on
multiple pages. This also makes it more convenient and user friendly for users.


* *Major Enhancement:* Implemented all navigation commands
** *What it does* +
Allows users to navigate between different pages conveniently through short commands such as `back` and `goto`. +


** *Justification* +
Rather than moving the mouse to click buttons, users can easily navigate through the pages without ever moving their hands away
from the keyboard.

* *Major Enhancement:* Implemented Home Page of application +
** *What it does* +
Allows users to view and manipulate the trip list in the application, and view past and upcoming trips at a glance.
** *Justification* +
Rather than implementing a single sorted list view, distinguishing between past and upcoming trips will make it more
convenient for users to view their trips and a comprehensive glance.


* *Major Enhancement:* Designed the GUI for the application
** *Justification* +
I wanted to completely move away from the Address Book 3 design and differentiate our application from
the rest of the teams. I also wanted the text of our GUI to be bigger and more readable.
** *Credits* +
GUI design was inspired by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_1.0[Windows 1.0.]

* *Major Enhancement:* Implemented Help Windows for different views
** *What it does* +
Every view on the application has a custom Help Window detailing the commands that can be used on each page.
** *Justification* +
Implementing a general help page with every single command is not convenient for users as they have to scroll through
the entire help page to find the commands for the page they are on. It is much more convenient to directly show users
what commands can be used on the page they are specifically on.
